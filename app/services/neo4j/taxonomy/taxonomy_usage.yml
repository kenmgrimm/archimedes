# USAGE NOTES
# ======================

usage_notes:
  relationship_patterns:
    - "Person entities can represent humans, pets, or livestock with different dynamic_properties"
    - "Item vs DigitalItem distinction is crucial for proper modeling"
    - "Locations can contain other locations (rooms in houses, areas on farms)"
    - "Collections organize related entities and provide grouping context"
    - "Activities track time-based events, projects, and recurring tasks"
    - "Information captures knowledge, notes, and reference materials"
  
  dynamic_properties_best_practices:
    - "Use consistent naming within similar entity types"
    - "Store complex data as nested JSON when appropriate"
    - "Include relevant identifiers (serial numbers, IDs, registration numbers)"
    - "Track status and condition information"
    - "Document source and provenance information"
  
  common_relationship_patterns:
    - "OWNS connects people to their possessions (physical and digital)"
    - "DOCUMENTS creates links between digital items and what they represent"
    - "LOCATED_AT and CONTAINS establish spatial relationships"
    - "PART_OF creates hierarchical groupings"
    - "USES and PARTICIPATES_IN show activity involvement"
    - "ABOUT creates topical connections to information"
  
  scalability_considerations:
    - "Each scenario shows 10-20 entities but real usage could be 100x larger"
    - "Dynamic properties allow unlimited expansion without schema changes"
    - "Relationship patterns remain consistent regardless of scale"
    - "Collections help organize large numbers of similar entities"
