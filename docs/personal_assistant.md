# Personal Assistant RAG System: Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Personal Assistant RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system is an AI-powered personal assistant designed to organize, track, and enhance your daily life through intelligent data management and context-aware recommendations.

## Architecture Philosophy: Rapid Development First, Self-Contained as a Goal

While the long-term vision is for the system to be fully self-contained and able to run without external dependencies, rapid development and iteration are prioritized in the early phases. **Starting with the OpenAI API (or similar hosted LLMs) is not only acceptable, but encouraged** to accelerate feature delivery and experimentation.

- **OpenAI API for LLMs**: Initial development leverages OpenAI's API for language model capabilities, enabling fast prototyping and robust results out of the box.
- **Aspirational Self-Containment**: The goal is to eventually support running on local hardware with self-hosted LLMs and vector databases, but this is a future milestone, not a launch requirement.
- **No Unnecessary Lock-In**: The system is designed so that external dependencies (like OpenAI) can be swapped for local models as technology and project maturity allow.
- **Local Development**: All other components are built to run locally on a MacBook during development.
- **Optimized LLM Usage**: As self-hosted LLMs mature, the system will support compact, hardware-optimized models for local inference.
- **Apple Silicon Support**: Optimized for M4 chips with GPU acceleration while maintaining simplicity.
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Fully functional on both desktop computers and mobile devices.

This approach enables rapid progress and user feedback, while keeping the door open for a fully self-contained, privacy-first architecture in the future.

## Core Capabilities

### Human-Like Web Browsing & Automation

The assistant is capable of browsing the web as the user, emulating human behavior to avoid detection and blocking. This includes:

- **Web Search & Exploration**: Conducting searches and exploring websites as a human would, respecting rate limits and interaction patterns
- **Event Discovery**: Finding upcoming events, shows, or relevant activities
- **Marketplace & Shopping**: Browsing for items for sale, monitoring listings, and even purchasing items (e.g., through Amazon) on the user's behalf
- **Order Management**: Checking the status of orders (e.g., Amazon, eBay) and notifying the user of updates
- **Account Actions**: Logging in, filling forms, and performing actions that require authentication, with user consent and secure credential handling

### Data Ingestion & Knowledge Management

The system can ingest and process various types of personal data:

- **Personal Notes & Documents**: Text notes, documents, PDFs
- **To-Do Lists**: Task lists with priorities, deadlines, and completion tracking
- **Grocery Lists**: Shopping items with categories, quantities, and store preferences
- **Reminders**: Time and location-based notifications for important tasks
- **Financial Information**: Receipts, expenses, budgets
- **Goal Tracking**: Personal and professional goals with milestones
- **Media**: Photos, videos, audio recordings
- **Calendar & Events**: Meetings, appointments, deadlines
- **Shopping & Marketplace**: Wishlists, shopping needs, marketplace listings
- **Location Data**: Frequent locations, stores visited

### Vector Store Implementation

All data is processed and stored in a vector database for semantic retrieval:

- **Embedding Generation**: All content is transformed into vector embeddings
- **Contextual Chunking**: Documents are intelligently chunked to preserve context
- **Metadata Tagging**: Rich metadata allows for filtered retrieval
- **Multi-modal Support**: Handles text, images, and structured data

### Autonomous Features

The system operates with significant autonomy to provide value without constant user input:

- **Web Scraping**: Monitors marketplaces (Facebook, eBay, Craigslist) for items of interest
- **Proactive Notifications**: Alerts for relevant deals, calendar events, goal deadlines
- **Location-Aware Assistance**: Recognizes when you're at specific stores and provides relevant shopping lists
- **Schedule Management**: Plans daily/weekly/monthly activities based on goals and commitments

## Technical Architecture

   - OCR for physical documents and receipts
   - Web scraper for marketplace listings

2. **Processing Layer**
   - Text extraction and normalization
   - Entity recognition for dates, amounts, products
   - Image analysis and tagging
   - Duplicate detection and metadata enrichment

3. **Storage Layer**
   - Self-hosted vector database implementation
   - Local document store for raw files
   - Self-contained metadata database
   - User profile and preferences store

4. **Retrieval Layer**

   - Hybrid retrieval (keyword + vector)
   - Context-aware query construction
   - Result ranking and filtering

### Intelligent Planning System

- **Goal Decomposition**: Breaks down large goals into actionable tasks
- **Schedule Optimization**: Suggests optimal times for tasks and activities
- **Progress Tracking**: Automated tracking of goal progress with visualizations
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjusts plans based on actual progress and changing priorities

### Notification & Alert Framework

- **Priority-based Alerts**: Notification urgency based on time-sensitivity and importance
- **Channel Selection**: Intelligent selection of notification method (push, email, SMS)
- **Context-Aware Timing**: Delivers notifications at appropriate times
- **Action Integration**: Notifications include actionable elements

## User Experience

### Interaction Modalities

- **Chat Interface**: Natural language conversation for queries and commands
- **Voice Integration**: Hands-free interaction in appropriate contexts
- **Dashboard**: Visual overview of goals, schedule, and important information
- **Location Triggers**: Automatic assistance based on physical location

### Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: Privacy-sensitive data processed locally when possible
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive information
- **Granular Permissions**: User control over what data is collected and how it's used
- **Data Retention**: Configurable data retention policies
