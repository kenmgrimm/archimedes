# Qdrant Implementation Guide: Entities, Relationships, Vectorization, Querying, Visualization

## 1. Entity and Relationship Creation

### Example: Creating People, Mountains, and Relationships
```python
# Qdrant is vector-first, so entities are points with payloads
qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name="people",
    points=[{
        "id": "kaiser-id",
        "vector": kaiser_embedding,
        "payload": {"name": "Kaiser Soze", "hobby": "mountaineering", "location": "Colorado", "spouse": "nancy-id"}
    }]
)

qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name="mountains",
    points=[{
        "id": "elbert-id",
        "vector": elbert_embedding,
        "payload": {"name": "Mount Elbert", "elevation": 14440, "location": "Colorado"}
    }]
)
```

## 2. Vectorization (Embeddings)

- **Manual:** Generate embeddings using OpenAI or similar, store as vector

```python
kaiser_embedding = openai_client.embeddings("Kaiser Soze mountaineering Colorado")
# Use in upsert above
```

## 3. Querying: Vector Search & (Manual) Graph Traversal

### Vector Similarity Search
```python
# Find similar people
qdrant_client.search(
    collection_name="people",
    query_vector=kaiser_embedding,
    limit=5
)
```

### Graph Traversal
- **Manual:** Relationships are just payload fields; you must traverse in your application code.

```python
# Example: Find spouse and mountains climbed
person = qdrant_client.retrieve(collection_name="people", ids=["kaiser-id"])[0]
spouse_id = person["payload"]["spouse"]
spouse = qdrant_client.retrieve(collection_name="people", ids=[spouse_id])[0]
```

## 4. Deduplication (Entity Resolution)

- **Manual:** Use vector similarity + payload comparison

```python
# Find potential duplicates
results = qdrant_client.search(
    collection_name="people",
    query_vector=kaiser_embedding,
    limit=10
)
# Filter results in code where payload fields are similar and score > threshold
```

## 5. Visualization

- **Export:** Use REST API to export data for D3.js/Cytoscape visualization
- **No native visualization**
