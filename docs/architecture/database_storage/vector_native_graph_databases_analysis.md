# Vector-Native Graph Databases: Deep Dive Analysis

## What Are Vector-Native Graph Databases?

Traditional approach: **Graph DB + Vector DB** (separate systems)
Vector-native approach: **Single system** that natively handles both graph relationships AND vector similarity

Think of it as: "What if Neo4j and Pinecone had a baby?"

## Current Players (2024)

### 1. Weaviate (Most Mature)
**Status:** Production-ready, well-funded, strong community

```python
# Weaviate example - storing personal activities
import weaviate

client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")

# Define schema with both graph and vector properties
schema = {
    "classes": [
        {
            "class": "Activity",
            "properties": [
                {"name": "type", "dataType": ["string"]},
                {"name": "description", "dataType": ["text"]},
                {"name": "date", "dataType": ["date"]},
                {"name": "person", "dataType": ["Person"]},  # Graph relationship
                {"name": "relatedTo", "dataType": ["Activity"]}  # Self-referencing
            ],
            "vectorizer": "text2vec-openai"  # Auto-vectorization
        },
        {
            "class": "Person", 
            "properties": [
                {"name": "name", "dataType": ["string"]},
                {"name": "interests", "dataType": ["string[]"]},
                {"name": "goals", "dataType": ["Goal"]}
            ]
        }
    ]
}

# Store activity with automatic vectorization
client.data_object.create(
    data_object={
        "type": "learning",
        "description": "Read chapter on knowledge graphs in AI textbook",
        "date": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
        "person": {"beacon": "weaviate://localhost/Person/ken-grimm"},
        "relatedTo": [{"beacon": "weaviate://localhost/Activity/ai-project"}]
    },
    class_name="Activity"
)

# Query: Find similar activities with graph traversal
results = client.query.get("Activity", ["type", "description", "date"]) \
    .with_near_text({"concepts": ["learning about AI"]}) \
    .with_additional(["certainty", "distance"]) \
    .with_where({
        "path": ["person", "Person", "name"],
        "operator": "Equal",
        "valueString": "Ken Grimm"
    }) \
    .with_limit(10) \
    .do()

# Advanced: Graph + Vector hybrid query
complex_results = client.query.get("Activity") \
    .with_near_text({"concepts": ["AI project inspiration"]}) \
    .with_where({
        "operator": "And",
        "operands": [
            {
                "path": ["date"],
                "operator": "GreaterThan",
                "valueDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
            },
            {
                "path": ["relatedTo", "Activity", "type"],
                "operator": "Equal", 
                "valueString": "project"
            }
        ]
    }) \
    .do()
```

**Weaviate Advantages:**
- Mature ecosystem and documentation
- Auto-vectorization (no manual embedding generation)
- GraphQL-like query interface
- Multi-modal support (text, images, audio)
- Horizontal scaling
- Strong consistency guarantees

**Weaviate Limitations:**
- Graph queries less sophisticated than Neo4j
- Smaller community than traditional databases
- Learning curve for hybrid queries

### 2. Qdrant (Fast & Flexible)
**Status:** Rapidly growing, Rust-based (very fast)

```python
# Qdrant with graph extensions
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import Distance, VectorParams, PointStruct

client = QdrantClient("localhost", port=6333)

# Create collection with graph metadata
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="personal_knowledge",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=1536, distance=Distance.COSINE)
)

# Store with graph relationships in payload
client.upsert(
    collection_name="personal_knowledge",
    points=[
        PointStruct(
            id="activity_001",
            vector=embedding_vector,  # OpenAI embedding
            payload={
                "type": "activity",
                "subtype": "learning", 
                "description": "Read AI textbook chapter",
                "date": "2024-01-15",
                "person_id": "ken-grimm",
                "relationships": {
                    "influenced_by": ["book_ai_modern_approach"],
                    "influences": ["project_archimedes"],
                    "similar_to": ["activity_002", "activity_015"]
                },
                "metadata": {
                    "confidence": 0.95,
                    "source": "manual_entry"
                }
            }
        )
    ]
)

# Hybrid search: Vector similarity + graph filtering
search_results = client.search(
    collection_name="personal_knowledge",
    query_vector=query_embedding,
    query_filter={
        "must": [
            {"key": "type", "match": {"value": "activity"}},
            {"key": "date", "range": {"gte": "2024-01-01"}},
            {"key": "relationships.influences", "match": {"any": ["project_archimedes"]}}
        ]
    },
    limit=10,
    with_payload=True
)

# Graph traversal simulation
def find_influence_chain(start_id, max_depth=3):
    chain = []
    current_ids = [start_id]
    
    for depth in range(max_depth):
        # Get all points that influence current points
        results = client.scroll(
            collection_name="personal_knowledge",
            scroll_filter={
                "must": [
                    {"key": "relationships.influences", "match": {"any": current_ids}}
                ]
            }
        )
        
        if not results[0]:  # No more influences found
            break
            
        chain.append(results[0])
        current_ids = [point.id for point in results[0]]
    
    return chain
```

**Qdrant Advantages:**
- Extremely fast (Rust-based)
- Flexible payload structure
- Good for custom graph logic
- Strong vector search performance
- Cost-effective

**Qdrant Limitations:**
- Graph features are manual/custom
- Less mature graph query language
- More development work required

### 3. LanceDB (Emerging)
**Status:** Very new, backed by strong team

```python
# LanceDB - columnar vector database with graph potential
import lancedb

db = lancedb.connect("./personal_knowledge.lance")

# Create table with both vector and graph columns
table = db.create_table("activities", [
    {"id": "activity_001", 
     "vector": embedding_vector,
     "type": "learning",
     "description": "Read AI textbook",
     "date": "2024-01-15",
     "person": "ken-grimm",
     "influenced_by": ["book_001"],
     "influences": ["project_001"],
     "tags": ["ai", "learning", "textbook"]}
])

# Vector search with graph filtering
results = table.search(query_vector) \
    .where("type = 'learning' AND date > '2024-01-01'") \
    .limit(10) \
    .to_list()

# Graph traversal (manual implementation needed)
def traverse_influences(activity_id, depth=2):
    current = table.search().where(f"id = '{activity_id}'").to_list()[0]
    influences = current.get("influences", [])
    
    if depth <= 0 or not influences:
        return [current]
    
    result = [current]
    for influence_id in influences:
        result.extend(traverse_influences(influence_id, depth - 1))
    
    return result
```

## Comparison: Vector-Native vs Your Current Stack

### Your Current: PostgreSQL + pgvector
```sql
-- What you have now
SELECT e.*, similarity(e.embedding, $1) as score
FROM entities e 
WHERE e.embedding <-> $1 < 0.3
  AND e.properties->>'type' = 'activity'
  AND e.created_at > '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY e.embedding <-> $1
LIMIT 10;

-- Graph relationships via joins
SELECT e1.name, r.relationship_type, e2.name
FROM entities e1
JOIN relationships r ON e1.id = r.from_entity_id  
JOIN entities e2 ON r.to_entity_id = e2.id
WHERE e1.id = $1;
```

### Vector-Native: Weaviate
```python
# Single query does both vector + graph
results = client.query.get("Activity") \
    .with_near_text({"concepts": ["AI learning"]}) \
    .with_where({"path": ["date"], "operator": "GreaterThan", "valueDate": "2024-01-01"}) \
    .with_additional(["certainty"]) \
    .do()
```

## Should You Switch? Decision Matrix

### Stick with PostgreSQL + pgvector IF:
- ✅ You want to minimize complexity
- ✅ Your team knows SQL well
- ✅ You need ACID transactions
- ✅ You have complex business logic in Rails
- ✅ You're building incrementally

### Switch to Vector-Native IF:
- ✅ Graph queries are becoming complex
- ✅ You need real-time similarity search
- ✅ You want auto-vectorization
- ✅ You're comfortable with newer tech
- ✅ Performance is critical

## Practical Recommendation for Archimedes

### Phase 1: Stay with PostgreSQL (for now)
Your current stack is solid. Vector-native DBs are still maturing.

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approach (6 months from now)
```ruby
# Use Weaviate as a semantic layer on top of PostgreSQL
class KnowledgeGraphService
  def initialize
    @postgres = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
    @weaviate = WeaviateClient.new
  end
  
  def store_activity(activity_data)
    # Store in PostgreSQL for ACID compliance
    entity = Entity.create!(activity_data)
    
    # Async job: Also store in Weaviate for semantic search
    WeaviateSyncJob.perform_later(entity.id)
    
    entity
  end
  
  def semantic_search(query)
    # Use Weaviate for complex semantic queries
    @weaviate.search(query)
  end
  
  def structured_query(sql)
    # Use PostgreSQL for structured queries
    @postgres.execute(sql)
  end
end
```

### Phase 3: Full Migration (if needed)
Only if vector-native proves significantly better for your use case.

## Real-World Performance Comparison

### Query: "Find activities similar to my AI project work from the last 3 months"

**PostgreSQL + pgvector:**
```sql
-- 2 separate queries needed
-- 1. Vector similarity
-- 2. Graph relationships
-- Total: ~50-100ms
```

**Weaviate:**
```python
# Single hybrid query
# Total: ~20-30ms
# Plus auto-vectorization
```

## Bottom Line Recommendation

**For Archimedes right now: Stick with PostgreSQL + pgvector**

**Reasons:**
1. Your Rails integration is already working
2. Vector-native DBs are still evolving rapidly
3. PostgreSQL gives you more control and flexibility
4. You can always add Weaviate later as a semantic layer

**Consider switching when:**
1. You're doing 100+ complex graph queries per day
2. Real-time semantic search becomes critical
3. Auto-vectorization would save significant development time
4. Your data grows beyond PostgreSQL's sweet spot

The vector-native approach is genuinely exciting and represents the future, but your current stack is already quite modern and capable. Evolution over revolution makes sense here.
