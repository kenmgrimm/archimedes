# Personal AI Assistant with Neo4j GraphRAG

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive personal AI assistant using Neo4j GraphRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). The system will serve as a digital extension of yourself, maintaining detailed knowledge about all aspects of your life, from daily tasks to long-term goals, and providing intelligent assistance based on this knowledge.

## Core Capabilities
1. **Personal Knowledge Base**
   - Track personal information, goals, and responsibilities
   - Maintain detailed records of possessions and their maintenance
   - Manage contacts and relationships
   - Store and retrieve documents and notes

2. **Life Management**
   - Task and project tracking
   - Shopping and inventory management
   - Calendar and event management
   - Financial tracking and budgeting

3. **Intelligent Assistance**
   - Natural language querying of personal data
   - Proactive reminders and suggestions
   - Decision support based on personal context
   - Knowledge retrieval and summarization

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Neo4j Database**: Central graph database storing all personal knowledge
2. **GraphRAG Service**: Manages graph operations and LLM integration
3. **Data Integration Layer**: Handles data import from various sources
4. **Natural Language Interface**: Processes and responds to user queries
5. **Automation Engine**: Handles reminders, alerts, and proactive assistance

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Neo4j Setup & Configuration
- [x] Install Neo4j Community Edition
- [ ] Configure vector index for semantic search
- [ ] Set up authentication and secure access
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring

### 2. Core Data Model Implementation
- [ ] Define and implement core schemas:
  - Person/User/Contact models
  - Task/Project management
  - Inventory and possessions
  - Calendar and events
  - Document management
- [ ] Set up constraints and indexes
- [ ] Implement data validation rules

### 3. GraphRAG Service
- [ ] Implement GraphRAG service with Neo4j client
- [ ] Add entity extraction and relationship mapping
- [ ] Implement vector embeddings for semantic search
- [ ] Add LLM integration for natural language understanding
- [ ] Implement context-aware response generation

### 4. Data Integration
- [ ] Import existing data from:
  - Calendar (iCal/Google Calendar)
  - Contacts (vCard/Google Contacts)
  - Task managers (Todoist, etc.)
  - Documents and notes
- [ ] Set up periodic sync with external services
- [ ] Implement data deduplication

### 5. API & Integration Layer
- [ ] REST/GraphQL API endpoints:
  - `/api/query` - Natural language query endpoint
  - `/api/knowledge` - Knowledge management
  - `/api/tasks` - Task and project management
  - `/api/calendar` - Event management
  - `/api/inventory` - Possessions tracking
- [ ] Webhook support for external integrations
- [ ] Authentication and authorization

## Example Workflows

### 1. Task Management
```
User: "Remind me to change the air filters in 3 months"

System:
1. Creates a Task node with due date in 3 months
2. Links to existing Air Filter nodes in inventory
3. Sets up reminder notification
4. Suggests adding to calendar for tracking
```

### 2. Knowledge Query
```
User: "What's the model of my car and when is the next oil change due?"

System:
1. Queries for Vehicle nodes owned by user
2. Retrieves maintenance history
3. Calculates next service date
4. Returns: "Your 2021 Tesla Model 3 is due for an oil change in 2,300 miles (approximately 3 months)."
```

### 3. Relationship Context
```
User: "What's my wife's cousin's name and when is his birthday?"

System:
1. Traverses relationship graph
2. Returns: "Your wife's cousin is Michael Brown. His birthday is March 15, 1985 (turning 40 next year)."
```
