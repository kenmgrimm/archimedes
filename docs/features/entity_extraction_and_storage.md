# Entity Extraction and Storage

## Overview
This document describes the process and requirements for extracting entities from OpenAI responses and storing them in the Archimedes application.

**Important:** All entities must strictly conform to the taxonomy defined in `app/services/openai/entity_taxonomy.yml`. Only entity types listed in this taxonomy are valid for extraction, classification, and storage.

## Requirements

1. **Entity Creation**
   - Use the OpenAI response (flat JSON with `description`, `annotated_description`, and `rating`) to extract and create related `Entity` records for each `Content`.
   - Entities must be classified by type and value, and the type must exactly match one of the types defined in `app/services/openai/entity_taxonomy.yml`.

2. **Classification**
   - Parse the `annotated_description` field to identify and classify entities.
   - Store each entity with its detected type and value.
   - Example: `[Organization: John Doe]` â†’ type: `organization`, value: `John Doe`.

3. **Association**
   - Each extracted entity should be associated with the parent `Content` record.
   - Optionally, associate with the specific file if the entity was derived from an uploaded file.

4. **Audit and Review**
   - Store the full OpenAI response body with the `Content` or each `Entity` for future review and auditing.
   - Ensure the response is accessible from the admin interface or via the Content detail page.

5. **Extensibility**
   - The extraction logic should be modular to allow future improvements (e.g., support for new entity types, improved parsing, or alternate LLMs).

## Implementation Notes
- Use robust parsing to extract entities from the `annotated_description` field.
- Consider storing both the raw and parsed entity data for traceability.
- Ensure all entity extraction and storage is covered by RSpec tests.
- Add debug logging for entity creation and error handling.
