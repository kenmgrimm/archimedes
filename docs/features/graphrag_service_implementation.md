# GraphRAG Service Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation strategy for the GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) service in Archimedes. The service combines the power of graph databases with large language models to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to complex queries.

## The Challenge
As Archimedes grows, users need more than just simple data retrievalâ€”they need intelligent, context-aware responses to complex queries like:
- "What's the best time to schedule my next car maintenance considering my calendar and the last service?"
- "Find documents related to my home renovation project that I haven't looked at in the past month."
- "Who in my network knows about machine learning and is available for a coffee chat next week?"

## Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

#### 1. GraphRAG Service Skeleton
- Create `GraphRagService` with Neo4j client integration
- Set up configuration for model providers (OpenAI, local LLMs)
- Implement basic health checks and error handling
- Add logging and monitoring infrastructure

#### 2. Entity Recognition & Mapping
- Add NLP pipeline for entity extraction using spaCy
- Map extracted entities to Neo4j node types
- Implement relationship inference between entities
- Create entity resolution to handle duplicates and aliases

### Phase 2: Intelligent Search (Week 2)

#### 1. Vector Embeddings
- Generate embeddings for nodes using OpenAI's text-embedding-3
- Store embeddings efficiently in Neo4j using vector indexes
- Implement hybrid search combining graph patterns and vector similarity
- Add support for multi-modal embeddings (text, images, etc.)

#### 2. Query Understanding
- Add intent classification for common query patterns
- Implement query rewriting to optimize for graph traversal
- Add support for temporal reasoning in queries
- Handle negation and complex boolean logic in searches

### Phase 3: LLM Integration (Week 3)

#### 1. Context Assembly
- Build context windows from relevant graph subgraphs
- Implement result ranking and relevance scoring
- Add conversation history tracking
- Handle context window limitations intelligently

#### 2. Response Generation
- Create prompt templates for different query types
- Implement response formatting with source citations
- Add confidence scoring for generated responses
- Support for different output formats (text, JSON, etc.)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)

#### 1. Reasoning & Inference
- Add support for multi-hop reasoning
- Implement temporal reasoning for event sequences
- Add support for hypothetical scenarios
- Enable counterfactual reasoning

#### 2. Performance & Optimization
- Implement caching for frequent queries
- Add query planning and optimization
- Set up monitoring and analytics
- Implement rate limiting and cost controls

## Example Flows

### Example 1: Maintenance Scheduling
1. **User Query**: "When should I service my Tesla next?"
2. **System**:
   - Recognizes "Tesla" as a Vehicle entity
   - Queries maintenance history and requirements
   - Checks calendar for availability
   - **Response**: "Your Tesla Model 3 is due for service in 2 weeks. You have availability on Monday morning or Thursday afternoon."

### Example 2: Document Retrieval
1. **User Query**: "Find documents about home insurance from last year"
2. **System**:
   - Identifies document type and temporal context
   - Performs semantic search across documents
   - Filters by date and relevance
   - **Response**: "Here are 3 home insurance documents from 2024:
     1. Home Insurance Renewal (May 2024)
     2. Policy Update Notice (March 2024)
     3. Claim Form - Roof Damage (January 2024)"

## Success Metrics
- **Response Accuracy**: >90% on test queries
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for 95% of queries
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating
- **Query Success Rate**: >95% of queries resolved without fallback

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-modal Support**: Process and understand images, PDFs, and other document types
- **Proactive Notifications**: Alert users about important information before they ask
- **Expanded Data Sources**: Integrate with more services and data formats
- **Customizable Knowledge Domains**: Allow users to define custom entity types and relationships
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverage insights from similar users while respecting privacy
- **Explainability**: Show the reasoning path for complex queries

## Technical Dependencies
- Neo4j 5.x with Graph Data Science library
- OpenAI API or compatible LLM service
- Ruby on Rails 7.1+
- Redis for caching
- Sidekiq for background jobs

## Security Considerations
- All data access follows strict permission controls
- Sensitive data is never sent to external services without consent
- Audit logging for all data access and modifications
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
